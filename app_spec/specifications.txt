   - Routing: Built-in Next.js routing
   - Form Handling: Native React forms

2. Backend:
   - Language: Node.js
   - Framework: Next.js API Routes
   - Database: MongoDB (connection implemented via lib/mongodb.js)
   - API Design: RESTful APIs with Express server
   - Data Fetching: Custom MongoDB utility functions for collection operations

3. Authentication:
   - Authentication strategy not explicitly defined in provided code samples

4. Hosting:
   - Deployment platform appears to be compatible with Next.js
   - Static file generation for specific routes (/category/[slug], /news/[slug]) as seen in SSG manifest
   - Express server for backend API endpoints

5. Version Control:
   - Git for source code management
   - Repository structure follows standard web project organization
